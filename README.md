DiscoverOpal.com - theme
==================

This is the main theme for DiscoverOpal.com, a (hopefully interesting) little blog where we'll be sharing our adventures as we grow in our experience and have fun with Ruby in the browser, aka [Opal](http://opalrb.org). YAY - No more unattractive JavaScript syntax and conventions! 

This is a fork of the theme detailed at http://blog.justin.kelly.org.au/octopress-theme/ with some changes as per our preference.  A thanks to the original author for sharing his work!
